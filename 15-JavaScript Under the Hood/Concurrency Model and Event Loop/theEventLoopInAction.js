/*console.log("This is the first line of code in app.js."); is added to the stack, executes, then pops off of the stack.
setTimeout() is added to the stack.
setTimeout()â€™s callback is passed to be executed by a web API. The timer will run for 3 seconds. After 3 seconds elapse, the callback function, usingsetTimeout() is pushed to the Event Queue.
The Event Loop, meanwhile, will check periodically if the stack is cleared to handle any messages in the Event Queue.
console.log("This is the last line of code in app.js."); is added to the stack, executes, then pops off of the stack.
The stack is now empty, so the event loop pushes usingsetTimeout onto the stack.

usingsetTimeout pops off of the stack.*/
